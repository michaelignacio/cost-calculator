# Infrastructure Cost Calculator

A web interface that forecasts the infrastructure cost based on the ff. inputs: customer usage and expected growth.

## Getting Started

To clone the project, do the following command on your `LAMP`/`XAMPP`/`WAMP`'s `www` or `htdocs` directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/michaelignacio/cost-calculator.git
```

Make sure your webserver is running, and go to [localhost/lifetrack](http://localhost/lifetrack/) to view the web interface.

Alternatively, you can also access the Heroku version of the app here: [http://quiet-escarpment-68159.herokuapp.com/](http://quiet-escarpment-68159.herokuapp.com/)

## Built With

* HTML5, CSS3, PHP, JavaScript
* [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) - The Fetch API provides an interface for fetching resources (including across the network)
* [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) - Bulma is a free, open source CSS framework based on Flexbox

You can use your local server of choice - personally I used [LAMP stack built w/ Docker Compose](https://github.com/sprintcube/docker-compose-lamp).
